# HuffManCode
This Java program showcases the implementation of Huffman coding, a powerful variable-length encoding algorithm widely used for data compression. The algorithm efficiently assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies, resulting in optimal compression ratios. The program employs a binary tree data structure to construct the Huffman tree, with each leaf node representing a character and its associated probability. Users can input a filename to provide character probabilities, and the program dynamically builds the Huffman tree. Furthermore, it enables users to input a line of uppercase text for encoding and subsequently decodes the encoded output. The underlying use of binary trees enhances the clarity and modularity of the code, making it an instructive example of algorithmic implementation with practical applications in data compression.
